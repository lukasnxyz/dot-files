### Personal dot files
I basically just try to have the same development environment on all the systems I use. Alacritty, 
tmux, neovim, and sometimes vscode/jupyter notebook depending on the work I'm doing.

#### Quick start
Install configs and packages
```shell
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
