### Personal dot files
I basically just try to have the same development environment on all the systems I use. Alacritty, 
tmux, neovim, and sometimes vscode/jupyter notebook depending on the work I'm doing.

#### Deploy
Easily install packages and configs to your system
```shell
$ chmod +x deploy.sh
$ ./deploy.sh
```
