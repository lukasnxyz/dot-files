### Personal dot files
These are all the very basic things that I use and have configured on my Arch/Suckless system.

#### Setup programs in `local/src/`
In each respective directory run:
```bash
$ sudo make install
```

#### Neovim setup
Make sure you have [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart) installed.
